It has been over 6 months now since we have decided to pursue a
completely different strategy, a strategy that puts you, our friends in
the center of our operation. While we were always proud of our customer
service and performance of our virtual servers, we felt something was
missing. It turns out, once we started listening to you more closely
than ever, there are a lot of things you felt were needed to improve
your experience.

6 months ago this blog or the entire community services offered to you
weren't possible at all, and today I have the privilege to write the
very first blog post for you. Today you can use Biscuit, our pretty
management panel to issue commands to your VPS, manage DNS or get some
additional perks which will be revealed in due time. You have various
mediums to contact us - from informal IRC to the most formal ticket, we
are here for you all the time even if we are a small company.

WhereverÂ you are young or old, a developer or a Linux newcomer, we want
you to talk to us in our various communication channels, even if you are
not our customer - we want to know what makes you tick, what would make
YOUR experience with virtual servers much more enjoyable.

In the end, it is of my utmost pleasure to once again welcome you to
6sync community - together, we will build something others don't even
dare to think about.
