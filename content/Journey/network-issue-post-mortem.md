Unfortunately, the time has come where all of us had to go through the
storm – after one year of flawless network operation, something cracked
and we experienced downtime. This post serves as an explanation, and an
apology on our part – rest assured we are doing everything in our power
to prevent this from happening in the future.

Somewhere around 14:00 CET we received several notifications of servers
and VMs going offline, and immediately assigned on the job technicians
who started to troubleshoot the issue. Network access was fully restored
90 minutes later, after identifying and fixing the issue.

The downtime happened due to issues with a cable crossing patch panel in
Equinix DC between our cage and meet-me-room. The problem was an unusual
one, so it couldn’t be immediately identified. When the issue was
discovered network access was restored immediately. The cable crossing
will be reorganized to eliminate the single point of failure.

We believe it is important to mention that all VMs remained online
during network outage.

We apologize for for any issues this might have caused to you, and we
will be issuing SLA credits for this downtime during the week. Thank you
for staying with us, we love having you here.
