The release of CentOS 6 was something we eagerly anticipated, not only
because of its many new features and fixes, and fresh new packages, but
also because it brings even more benefits to each and every one of us
that love virtualization.

Here at 6sync we have been busy the last few weeks with testing, testing
and some more testing of the new CentOS 6 release, and now that its
finally announced by the CentOS team, we can't be more happy and proud
to offer you CentOS 6 image. CentOS 6 replaces CentOS 5 as
the preferred deployment option if CentOS is your thing, but we will be
supporting CentOS 5 in Biscuit for quite some time as well.

Some of the new features include ext4 (think, blazing fast performance),
newer kernel, updated PHP and various other pieces of software that will
make your life better, faster and more reliable.

We hope you will be enjoying this brand new CentOS release, and as
always, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us should you have
any questions.
