Few days ago we hinted our irc and twitter communities about upcoming
changes to our template offering. Today, we are happy to announce
addition of Ubuntu 12.10 template, as well as updates to CentOS, Debian
and Ubuntu 12.04 templates which are now very fresh! We hope you enjoy
using them as we are committed to keeping our templates offering
up-to-date and stable.

New Biscuit is still in development, and incorporates many of the ideas
you guys have been telling us about over the course of the last few
years. We will keep you in the loop as development progresses.
