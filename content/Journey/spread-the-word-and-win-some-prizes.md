Are you already our customer, or about to become one? Maybe you always
wanted to become a part of our family, but never had a good reason to
apart from our awesome service and great community? Or maybe, just
maybe, you are already part of our always-expanding army of evangelists?
Whoever you are and wherever you are, we are calling on you because we
need you and have prepared some prizes for the bravest, for the fittest
and the just plain lucky!

Think of ways that you can spread the word about 6sync and our service,
actually do it and send us a notification (mario AT 6sync.com) of how
and what you did, and why did you decide to do it exactly that way. The
chefs behind 6sync will decide on 8 best evangelist campaigns, and those
that we deem the best will receive a Dota2 invite on Steam – 3 invites
are reserved for new customers, and 5 are left for our existing
customers that implement an evangelist campaign. The best campaign will
also win our Kilo package (1GB RAM, 2vCPU, 40GB HDD, 600GiB) for entire
6 months. Today – all of you are our evangelists, make us proud!
