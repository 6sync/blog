It has been a long time since we actually posted something on this blog
- time really flies when you are having fun, and with all the
interaction going on we just didn't have the time to write anything! But
do not worry, behind the scenes our secret coding monkeys have been
working hard to deliver you a new batch of awesomeness in the form of
CentOS 5.6 template. Yes, that is right - starting today, you can deploy
CentOS 5.6 biscuits that will appear in your cookie jar almost
instantly.

If you have been running CentOS so far, goodness from 5.6 is only a "yum
update" away.

But that is certainly not all - some weeks ago, we had our first (of
many to come!) community meeting where we discussed a lot of nice
things, and we really liked the feedback you gave us - you folks are
made of pure awesome!

On to other matters, we have been giving away Portal2 for the last month
and it is now time to announce the winners - please congratulate Barry
Morrison and Shawn Hampton - we hope to see you in co-op soon! Sadly, we
were not able to get Portal2 copies for all of our customers, but we
hope to play with you online as well!

As we march forward into the dark, we could not be more grateful to each
one of you. It is you that constantly drive us forward to rethink the
way we do things and innovate, and the stories of our community,
performance and support are becoming legendary.

'Till next time, live long and prosper.
