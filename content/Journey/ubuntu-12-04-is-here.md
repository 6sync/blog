Ubuntu 12.04 is now available!

I know a lot of you have been eagerly awaiting this new release so we  
are please to announced we have freshly baked new Ubuntu 12.04
(Precise  
Pangolin) images available for immediate deployment. Along with a slew  
of updated packages comes Linux [kernel] version 3.2.

But most exciting of all, this release is special as it is a "long-term  
support" (LTS) edition. In English, that means this new version of  
Ubuntu will be supported and actively maintained for a whopping 5
years!  
For this reason we highly recommend it for all new Ubuntu server  
installations.

Enjoy.
