Just a quick note.. our Arch Linux images have been updated to nice
fresh 2011.08 versions to coincide with the new Arch 2011.08
installation media. Since Arch Linux is a rolling release the old
(2010.05) images were very long in the tooth so this is a nice refresh.
A few highlights include the new Linux 3.0 kernel and updated rc.conf
format.

Similarly, our Gentoo templates are also due for an update and will be
hitting Biscuit very soon! We'll update this post as soon they hit.
