In the past couple of weeks many of you approached us and asked what is
going on since it has been unusually quiet at 6sync. Well, in a way, we
are all happy that things are quiet, it means that there are no real
problems and can focus on other things. On the other hand, it could be a
sign of trouble - but not in this case, of course ;)

We are hard at work behind the counter of our bakery cooking something
really great for all you guys. By constantly challenging ourselves and
trying to improve our service, we hope to provide you with Â even better
performance and resilience, while delivering breakthroughs in value and
flexibility.

A lot of nice things are happening, and everything is moving along
nicely. We will keep you posted - in the mean time, enjoy your stay at
6sync and don't forget to tell your friends about us.
